# Module 2 Challenge for Data Analytics
VBA focuses on data organization and summarization.
## TB Solutions
It contains the workbook, VBA separate exports, and the images of my solution.
I ended up separating a lot of the pieces into separate modules. So to make it even more confusing, there is another macro whose sole purpose is to call the other macros.
A refactor might be in this project's future.
